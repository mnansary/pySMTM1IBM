The town I live in is quite small. 
It only has 45,000 inhabitants and is surrounded by farmland and forests. 
We also have a nice lake which is a great attraction in summer when many tourists come for holidays. 
I used to ice skate on the lake in winter when I was younger and the winters were colder. 
You can go swimming, sailing or windsurfing there and you even can learn how to wakeboard. 
My town is not far from a big city so people can go shopping there as well, as it only takes 15 minutes by train.
